# Solid-Angle-Computation

The solid angle is a three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional angle, measuring the "spread" of an object as seen from a particular point. 
It is used in various fields such as physics, astronomy, and acoustics, especially in computations involving sound or light radiating from a source

This project, I am glad to present the efficient method to compute solid angle base on Spherical Triangle Method.
